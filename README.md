# Custom-IDS-IPS-Deployment-Using-Suricata-and-Zeek
Implemented a virtualized IDS/IPS using Suricata and Zeek to monitor network traffic between VMs. Configured custom Suricata rules to detect port scans, brute-force attacks, and C2 traffic. Simulated attacks from a Kali Linux VM and analyzed detection logs for threat intelligence. Integrated log analysis for enhanced network security monitoring.
